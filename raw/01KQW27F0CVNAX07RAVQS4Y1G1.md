[![Hermes Agent Features](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HHduwNiXwAA6Nlf?format=jpg&name=small)](https://x.com/shmidtqq/article/2051307460208578864/media/2051229929837150208)

You hooked up Telegram. You picked a model. You type prompts, get answers, close the tab.

You're using 8% of Hermes.

The other 92%, persistent memory, session branching, file rollbacks, voice mode, 17-platform reach, custom slash commands, sits there untouched while you treat a fully-loaded agent like a slightly smarter ChatGPT.

This article is the 92%. 15 features, ranked by impact. Most Hermes users haven't touched a single one.

Quick context for newcomers: Hermes is a provider-agnostic AI agent. 100+ pre-built skills. Runs on 17 messengers from one process. Swaps models mid-session without restarting. Built portable, extensible, yours, not locked to one vendor like every other agent on the market.

Now the list.

---

## PART 1: The Setup You Skipped

> 1. **/personality + SOUL.md**
>
> Hermes reads SOUL.md at boot. Whatever's in it becomes your agent's voice forever, every session, every platform. /personality switches between named personas on the fly.
>
> Stop typing "you are a senior X expert" at the start of every chat. Write it once.

> 2. **MEMORY.md + USER.md**
>
> Two persistent files, read every session. MEMORY.md = project notebook. USER.md = what it knows about you. Indexed with FTS5 + LLM summarizer, so a memory from 8 weeks ago surfaces in today's session.
>
> You stop re-explaining yourself.

> 3. **/insights [days]**
>
> Cross-session analytics. Tokens burned, providers used, where the agent stalled, what you keep returning to. /insights 30 = last month at a glance.

> 4. **/snapshot**
>
> Save full Hermes state before doing something risky. Break things on purpose. /snapshot restore <id> to come back. Rollbacks for the agent itself.

---

## PART 2: Mid-Flight Controls

> 5. **/branch (alias /fork)**
>
> Branch the session like a git commit. Try a riskier path without burning your good context. Doesn't pan out? Come back.

[![branch screenshot](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HHdv-EBWwAAjMUw?format=jpg&name=small)](https://x.com/shmidtqq/article/2051307460208578864/media/2051231267312549888)

> 6. **/rollback**
>
> Filesystem checkpoints. Agent nuked your code? Skip git /rollback. Hermes saves every file it touched.

> 7. **/btw**
>
> Ephemeral side question. Uses session context, calls no tools, doesn't get persisted. The "quick gut check" command.

[![btw screenshot](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HHdrr0GWwAAGfwS?format=jpg&name=small)](https://x.com/shmidtqq/article/2051307460208578864/media/2051226555754397696)

> 8. **/steer and /queue**
>
> Three tool calls into a long run, you realize the agent is hitting prod instead of staging. Don't kill it. /steer use staging not prod. Next tool call sees the note. Cache stays warm. /queue lines up the next turn without breaking the current one.

> 9. **/yolo, /fast, /reasoning**
>
> Three power toggles. /yolo skips dangerous-command approvals. /fast flips to OpenAI Priority or Anthropic Fast Mode. /reasoning sets effort level for reasoning models. Most people stay on defaults forever and wonder why their sessions feel slow.

---

## PART 3: The Provider Lock-In That Isn't

> 10. **/model [--provider] [--global]**
>
> One command swaps the model. No restart. Anthropic Opus 4.7, OpenAI Codex (GPT-5.5 via OAuth, no API key), OpenRouter, NVIDIA NIM, Kimi, Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Vercel AI Gateway, Xiaomi MiMo, Step Plan, Arcee.

[![model screenshot](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HHdru4EXgAEIJFV?format=jpg&name=small)](https://x.com/shmidtqq/article/2051307460208578864/media/2051226608359407617)

    /model anthropic:claude-opus-4-7 for the heavy lift. /model openrouter:kimi-k2.6 for grunt work. State carries over.

> 11. **Auxiliary Models**
>
> The agent compresses context, summarizes sessions, generates titles, runs vision. You can route each to a different model. Opus 4.7 for the main brain, Haiku 4.5 for compression, a tiny model for titles.
>
> Stop paying Opus rates for Haiku-grade work.

---

## PART 4: The Reach You Never Activated

> 12. **The 17-Platform Gateway**
>
> Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, Email, SMS, Matrix, Mattermost, Feishu, WeCom, DingTalk, BlueBubbles, Home Assistant, QQBot, plus CLI and voice. One Hermes process drives all of them.

> 13. **/voice: Real-Time Voice on 4 Platforms**
>
> CLI, Telegram DMs, Discord channels, Discord voice rooms. Type /voice and talk. Walking, driving, eyes on something else, done.

[![voice screenshot](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HHdryBmWwAAd6LS?format=jpg&name=small)](https://x.com/shmidtqq/article/2051307460208578864/media/2051226662457491456)

> 14. **Cron + /webhook-subscriptions**
>
> Built-in scheduler. Plain language schedules.
>
> "Every Friday 5pm, summarize this week's GitHub commits, post to Slack [#standups](https://x.com/search?q=%2523standups&src=hashtag_click)."
>
> Pair with /webhook-subscriptions for the inverse: GitHub, Vercel, Stripe, uptime checks push payloads straight to your DMs. Zero tokens. Zero LLM cost. Zero latency.
>
> You're paying Zapier for this every month.

## PART 5: What Separates Real Users from Tourists

> 15. **Skills Are Slash Commands**
>
> This is the one. 100+ skills out of the box, every one a slash command. Hit /, autocomplete fires.

```text
/architecture-diagram, /excalidraw, /manim-video, /research-paper-writing, /linear, /google-workspace, /imessage, /youtube-content, /codex, /claude-code, /test-driven-development, /systematic-debugging.
```

> You can write your own. I built /sage. It spots outliers in my niche, scouts trends, drafts QTs and threads in my voice. Built once. Type /sage in any session, any platform, runs forever.
>
> Tourists use slash commands once a week. Real users built their entire workflow into them.

[![skills screenshot](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HHdr-DFWIAEaRpU?format=jpg&name=small)](https://x.com/shmidtqq/article/2051307460208578864/media/2051226869014339585)

You paid for an agent with persistent memory, 100+ skills, filesystem rollback, session branching, mid-flight steering, 17-platform reach, real-time voice, multi-provider routing, auxiliary model routing, cron, webhooks, and custom slash commands.

You used it as a slightly fancier telegram bot.

The tool wasn't underdelivering. You never gave it the instructions it was waiting for.

I publish settings, configurations, and unreleased Hermes tricks like these on my Telegram channel before they appear elsewhere.
