_Last month I wrote [7 Principles for Agent-Friendly CLIs](https://x.com/trevin/status/2037250000821059933). Since then I've been deep in CLI work, watching agents use them, and seeing them break in interesting ways._

Mid-April, [@Cloudflare](https://x.com/@Cloudflare) published [The CLI for all of Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cf-cli-local-explorer/), describing how they rebuilt Wrangler around a TypeScript schema that generates the CLI, the SDKs, the Terraform provider, and the MCP server from one source. Their Code Mode MCP serves their entire ~3,000-operation API in [under 1,000 tokens](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cf-cli-local-explorer/). They added /cdn-cgi/explorer/api, an OpenAPI-shaped runtime endpoint for agents. And they enforce naming rules across the entire CLI surface: always get, never info; always --force, never --skip-confirmations; always --json. Their framing for why: "manually enforcing consistency through reviews is Swiss cheese."

Shortly after, [@HeyGen](https://x.com/@HeyGen) launched [their CLI](https://github.com/heygen-com/heygen-cli), and I've been using it heavily since. Generating videos through agents, polling jobs, routing artifacts to webhooks. The practical experience is what earned it a spot here. Plenty of companies ship CLIs; this one's been the most agent-pleasant I've used.

The original 7 principles I wrote about were defensive: the things a CLI has to get right, or agents pay for it on every call. Don't hang on a TTY check, return JSON, make errors actionable, bound the output. That layer is still necessary but not enough.

The next layer is about compounding instead of not breaking. The CLI gets more useful the more agents use it, because agents come with persistent identity, asynchronous workflows, output that has to land somewhere, and friction that maintainers should hear about.

The 10 principles below come from my own CLI work (new project coming soon!) alongside what Cloudflare and HeyGen have published. Organized into 2 tiers. Five condense the original seven and five are new.

---

## Tier 1: Table Stakes

Don't break the agent. Agents are good at figuring things out, but when these aren't met, the deck is stacked against them. Every gap costs more tokens, more retries, and more failure modes that don't surface until production.

### 1. Non-interactive by default

Commands have to run without interactive prompts when an agent invokes them. When a subagent spawns a background process, there's nothing answering the prompt. The command hangs.

```bash
# Hangs forever waiting for a confirmation that will never come
$ mycli post delete post_8f2a < /dev/null
Are you sure you want to delete post_8f2a? [y/N]: ^C

# With --force: bypasses the prompt, agent gets through cleanly
$ mycli post delete post_8f2a --force
{"deleted":"post_8f2a"}
```

What good looks like: `--no-input` or equivalent on every command that might prompt; honest TTY detection that treats non-TTY as headless; `--yes` for confirmation bypass; structured input via flags or files for anything you used to collect through interactive menus. Cloudflare standardizes on `--force` for destructive bypass and explicitly bans `--skip-confirmations`. Pick the convention, then enforce it.

Silent hanging on a prompt is a blocker; inconsistent prompt-bypass behavior across subcommands is friction; a comprehensive non-interactive mode the agent can rely on without per-command lookups is the optimization target.

### 2. Structured, parseable output

A nicely aligned table with ANSI colors is for humans. An agent extracting a post ID needs JSON.

```bash
# Data on stdout, parseable directly with jq
$ mycli post list --json | jq '.posts[0].id'
"post_8f2a"

# Errors go to stderr, exit codes signal failure class
$ mycli post get post_does_not_exist --json
$ echo $?
4
# stderr → "error: post not found: post_does_not_exist"
```

What good looks like: `--json` on every data-returning command; exit code 0 for success, non-zero for failure with a stable taxonomy if you can manage it; results to stdout, diagnostics to stderr; ANSI suppressed when output isn't a terminal. The newer wrinkle, from Cloudflare: pick one flag. Always `--json`, not `--format=json` for some commands and `--output json` for others. Inconsistency at this layer is its own category of brokenness.

No structured output at all is a blocker; coverage gaps where some commands are JSON-capable and others aren't is friction; uniform `--json` across the CLI with clean stdout/stderr separation and a documented exit code taxonomy is the optimization target.

### 3. Errors that teach, and enumerate

The original principle was "fail fast with actionable errors." That still holds, with one refinement I missed the first time. When the failure is "you passed an invalid value for X," the error should include the valid set.

```bash
# Unhelpful: agent has to read --help, parse, guess, retry
$ mycli post create --json --visibility=secret --content="hi"
error: invalid visibility

# Better: error names the valid set, agent self-corrects in one retry
$ mycli post create --json --visibility=secret --content="hi"
error: --visibility must be one of: public, private, unlisted (got: "secret")
```

HeyGen's CLI applies this consistently: pass an unknown delivery scheme and you get a structured refusal naming what is supported.

The pattern generalizes. Any time your CLI rejects user input against an enum, an enum-shaped resource list, or a schema, surface the enumeration in the error. Errors are the highest-signal context an agent gets, because they fire exactly when the agent doesn't know what to do next.

What good looks like: errors validated early, before side effects; correct invocation syntax in the error text; valid values enumerated when an enum is the cause; concrete examples instead of stack traces.

Silent or vague failures are a blocker; errors that name the problem but not the solution are friction; errors that include the valid set and a working invocation are the optimization target.

### 4. Safe retries and explicit mutation boundaries

Agents retry. Humans glance at a duplicate row and notice; agents don't.

```bash
# Idempotent create — second call returns the existing resource, not a duplicate
$ mycli post create --json --content="hello world"
{"id":"post_8f2a","existing":false}
$ mycli post create --json --content="hello world"
{"id":"post_8f2a","existing":true}

# Destructive ops require an explicit flag; --dry-run shows what would happen
$ mycli post delete post_8f2a --dry-run
{"would_delete":"post_8f2a","status":"dry_run"}
```

What good looks like: idempotency tokens or natural keys for create operations, so a retried create returns the existing resource instead of a duplicate; `--dry-run` for anything consequential; explicit, non-default flags for destructive operations; identifiers returned in every mutation response so the agent has something to reference on the next call.

The new wrinkle is async, which I'll come back to in principle 8. Retries on a long-running operation aren't just about idempotency at submission; they're about idempotency across the whole submit-poll-collect arc. If the agent's first invocation submits a job and then loses connection mid-poll, the second invocation needs to find the in-flight job, not start a new one. A persistent job ledger solves this.

Silent duplication or state corruption on retry is a blocker; destructive commands that are scriptable without preview are friction; idempotent mutations, durable job state, and explicit destructive flags are the optimization target.

### 5. Bounded responses, at every layer

Tokens cost money and context. Big outputs are sometimes justified, but the default should be narrow.

```bash
# Default page size is bounded; truncation tells the agent how to narrow
$ mycli post list --json
{"posts":[...20 items...],"truncated":true,"hint":"add --limit=N or --filter=author:..."}

# Cursor for explicit continuation
$ mycli post list --json --cursor=abc123
{"posts":[...],"next":null}
```

The original principle covered runtime output: list returning ten thousand rows, logs dumping forever. Cloudflare added a layer the original missed: the tool description surface itself costs tokens. Their Code Mode MCP serves over 3,000 operations in under 1,000 tokens. Most MCP servers I've seen burn 1,000 tokens on a single tool's description.

Both layers matter. A bloated MCP description never gets read by a human, but every agent that loads it pays the toll on every call.

What good looks like: filtering, pagination, and limits on every list-style command; concise vs. detailed modes; truncation messages that teach the agent how to narrow the next query; summary-before-detail responses. For MCP wrappers: a budget per tool description, audited at build time, not "however much explanation felt natural."

Routine commands dumping unbounded output are a blocker; broad defaults with available narrowing are friction; bounded defaults that guide better queries plus an MCP surface where each tool's description fits in a tweet are the optimization target.

---

## Tier 2: Compounding

Empower the agent. Tier 1 keeps you in the game. Tier 2 makes the CLI better the more it gets used. These are the principles I didn't see when I wrote the original and feel obvious now.

### 6. Cross-CLI vocabulary consistency

This is the principle I'm most certain about, and the one most under-stated in the original.

Agents don't memorize one CLI at a time. They build a generalized model of what CLIs do, drawn from every CLI they've seen. When your tool uses info for what every other tool calls get, the agent doesn't fail; it succeeds slowly, with extra retries, after burning tokens on --help. Multiply that across thousands of agent invocations per week and the cost is real.

```bash
# Conforming to the convention — agents recognize these immediately
$ wrangler kv namespace list --json
$ heygen videos list --json
$ mycli posts list --json

# Off-convention versions an agent has to relearn for each tool
$ mycli posts ls               # use list, not ls
$ mycli posts info abc         # use get, not info
$ mycli post delete abc \
    --skip-confirmations       # use --force, not --skip-*
$ mycli post list \
    --format=json              # use --json, not --format=json
```

Cloudflare made this explicit. Their schema-layer rules:

- Always get, never info
- Always list, never ls
- Always --force, never --skip-confirmations
- Always --json, never --format=json

The framing they used is the right one: "manually enforcing consistency through reviews is Swiss cheese." Vocabulary consistency has to be enforced mechanically, at the codegen or schema layer, because human review will always let edge cases slip.

The principle generalizes beyond Cloudflare's specific list. Pick the convention the broader community already uses (Unix --yes for skip-prompt, --limit for pagination, the get/list/create/update/delete verb set), and don't deviate without strong reason. Where you do have to invent vocabulary because the concept is genuinely new, name it consistently across your own commands and document it once, prominently.

What good looks like: a documented naming policy; a static check in CI that fails on banned verbs and flag aliases; canonical names that match the dominant convention in your language community.

Verbs and flags that contradict universal conventions (info instead of get, --skip-confirmations instead of --force) are a blocker; internal inconsistency between your own subcommands is friction; schema-enforced vocabulary that an agent trained on neighboring CLIs recognizes on first encounter is the optimization target.

### 7. Three-layer introspection

The original principle here was "progressive help discovery": top-level --help lists commands, subcommand --help shows usage. That's still true, but it's now the bottom layer of a three-layer stack. Each layer answers a different question.

```bash
# Layer 1 — what does this command do? (human-shaped text)
$ mycli --help
mycli  Manage posts and accounts.

USAGE: mycli <command> [flags]

COMMANDS:
  post      Manage posts
  account   Manage accounts
  jobs      Inspect async jobs
  profile   Manage saved configurations
  feedback  Send feedback upstream

# Layer 2 — what's the shape of everything? (structured, versioned)
$ mycli agent-context | jq '.schema_version, (.commands | keys)'
"1"
["account","feedback","jobs","post","profile"]

$ mycli agent-context | jq '.commands.post.subcommands.create.flags'
{
  "--content":     {"type":"string","required":true},
  "--visibility":  {"type":"enum","values":["public","private","unlisted"]},
  "--json":        {"type":"bool","default":false},
  "--dry-run":     {"type":"bool","default":false}
}

# Layer 3 — when would I use this? (long-form skill manifest)
$ cat $(mycli skill-path)/SKILL.md
# Publishing a post end-to-end
1. Save a profile for your default audience.
2. Create the post with --wait so the artifact returns synchronously.
3. Use --deliver=webhook:... to ship it downstream.
```

`--help` is necessary because some agents will hit it before anything else, and because a human dropping into the terminal needs it. `agent-context` is what an introspecting agent should actually consume: versioned, machine-readable JSON describing the full shape. Cloudflare's /cdn-cgi/explorer/api is the runtime version of this idea; the equivalent for a CLI is a top-level subcommand. The CLIs I've been generating ship `<cli> agent-context` with a schema_version field, exactly so the consuming agent can detect breaking shape changes.

The skill manifest is the third layer: long-form prose teaching the agent how to compose operations into useful workflows. HeyGen ships a [skills repo](https://github.com/heygen-com/skills) of SKILL.md files alongside their CLI, and Cloudflare's MCP server is the equivalent: a description of the CLI from the perspective of the tasks an agent might use it for, not the commands it exposes.

What good looks like: all three layers present, each versioned, each kept in sync with the implementation by the same generation step.

A CLI with only `--help` and nothing structured is a blocker; an agent-context that exists but isn't versioned, or skill manifests that drift from the actual command surface, is friction; three layers, schema-versioned, machine-validated against the real implementation is the optimization target.

### 8. Async-aware execution

Most CLIs treat async APIs the way the underlying HTTP endpoint does: submit returns a job ID, poll returns a status, that's the agent's problem. Two failure modes follow. Either the agent writes its own poll loop (wasting tokens and getting it subtly wrong), or it doesn't, and the workflow fails because the result wasn't ready when the next step ran.

The fix is `--wait`.

```bash
# Without --wait: the agent has to write its own polling loop
$ mycli video render --script=story.txt
{"job_id":"job_8f2a","status":"queued"}
$ mycli video status job_8f2a
{"job_id":"job_8f2a","status":"running","progress":0.34}
$ mycli video status job_8f2a
{"job_id":"job_8f2a","status":"running","progress":0.71}
$ mycli video status job_8f2a
{"job_id":"job_8f2a","status":"complete","url":"https://.../out.mp4"}

# With --wait: same workflow, one command, no polling logic
$ mycli video render --script=story.txt --wait
{"job_id":"job_8f2a","status":"complete","url":"https://.../out.mp4"}

# The job ledger survives across invocations
$ mycli jobs list
JOB_ID    STATUS    KIND          STARTED              DURATION
job_8f2a  complete  video.render  2026-04-30T18:22:11  37s
job_7c14  running   video.render  2026-04-30T18:24:02  12s
```

`--wait` blocks until completion. Behind it, the CLI runs a poll loop with backoff and writes job state to a local ledger. A jobs command exposes the ledger: jobs list shows in-flight and recent jobs, jobs get <id> retrieves status, jobs prune clears old entries.

This collapses several agent turns into one. Same workflow, fewer tokens, no polling logic the agent has to get right. The job ledger matters for retries (see principle 4): if the agent's `--wait` invocation gets killed mid-poll, the next invocation finds the existing job rather than submitting a new one.

What good looks like: `--wait` on every submitting command that wraps an async API; a polling implementation with exponential backoff and jitter; a persistent job ledger (~/.<cli>/jobs.jsonl is fine); a jobs parent command exposing list/get/prune.

Async commands that return a job ID and stop, forcing the agent to write a polling loop, are a blocker; `--wait` that exists but doesn't survive disconnect, or no way to inspect or recover in-flight jobs, is friction; `--wait` on every async submission with a durable, recoverable ledger is the optimization target.

### 9. Persistent identity through profiles

Agents don't show up once. They show up tomorrow, and the day after, and a week from now, in a different shell, with the same underlying intent and a different specific input. Stateless leaf-shaped CLIs make every invocation re-specify the same eight flags.

The fix is a profile system.

```bash
# Save a named bundle of configuration once
$ mycli profile save my-podcast \
    --avatar=lila \
    --voice=warm-en \
    --webhook=https://podcast.example.com/hook
profile saved: my-podcast

# Reuse it on every subsequent invocation
$ mycli video create --profile=my-podcast --script=ep_42.txt
{"job_id":"job_8f2a","using_profile":"my-podcast"}

# Explicit flags win over profile values
$ mycli video create --profile=my-podcast --voice=energetic --script=...
{"job_id":"job_a91","using_profile":"my-podcast","voice":"energetic"}

# Surfaced through introspection so agents discover available identities
$ mycli agent-context | jq '.available_profiles'
["my-podcast","client-demo","weekly-recap"]
```

The precedence I'd recommend: explicit flag > environment variable > profile > default. Surfacing the available profile names in agent-context matters: it's how an introspecting agent discovers which identities exist without parsing a config file.

Once an agent has a profile, the per-invocation flag burden drops to the parts that actually vary, the cross-session identity is durable without the agent having to write its own state file, and the human and the agent share the same configuration vocabulary.

What good looks like: profile save / use / list / show / delete subcommands; `--profile <name>` as a persistent root flag; profile contents shown in agent-context; a stable storage location like ~/.<cli>/profiles.json.

No way to persist configuration is a blocker; profiles that exist but aren't discoverable via introspection are friction; named profiles with clean precedence, surfaced through agent-context, are the optimization target.

### 10. Two-way I/O

The original principle 6 (composable and predictable structure) covered stdin/stdout pipelining. That's still true. But agents don't only consume CLIs through pipes, and the CLI doesn't only emit through stdout. There are two new mechanisms worth adding: a way for the CLI to emit artifacts where the agent actually needs them, and a way for the agent to report friction back.

```bash
# --deliver routes the artifact to where it's actually needed
$ mycli video create --script=story.txt --deliver=stdout
{"video_url":"https://.../out.mp4","duration_s":47}

$ mycli video create --script=story.txt --deliver=file:./out.mp4
{"delivered_to":"file:./out.mp4","bytes":4823091}

$ mycli video create --script=story.txt \
    --deliver=webhook:https://example.com/hook
{"delivered_to":"webhook:https://example.com/hook","status":201}

# Unknown schemes get a structured refusal naming what's supported
$ mycli video create --script=... --deliver=s3:bucket/key
error: --deliver scheme must be one of: stdout, file:<path>, webhook:<url>

# feedback closes the loop in the other direction
$ mycli feedback "the --tier flag rejects 'enterprise' but the docs list it as valid"
feedback recorded locally (1 entry)

$ mycli feedback list
2026-04-30T18:31:02  the --tier flag rejects 'enterprise' but the docs list it as valid

# Optional upstream POST when configured
$ MYCLI_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT=https://maintainers.example.com/cli-feedback \
    mycli feedback "race condition in --wait when job completes during the first poll"
feedback recorded locally and sent upstream (status: 200)
```

`--deliver` routes the artifact directly: stdout, a file path, or a webhook URL. A video that lands as an MP4 at a known path, or POSTs to a webhook the agent already set up, is one fewer hop than "stdout to a temp file then move." File sinks write atomically; webhook sinks POST and surface HTTP status; unknown schemes return a structured refusal. HeyGen's framing for this was "fewer steps between agent output and a finished artifact."

`feedback` runs the other way. Agents hit friction constantly: flags rejected for the wrong reason, race conditions in async paths, error messages that don't enumerate. Most of it never gets reported because there's no channel: the agent retries, eventually succeeds, the maintainer never learns the call was painful. `<cli> feedback "..."` writes locally by default; with an endpoint configured, the entry POSTs upstream too.

What good looks like: `--deliver` with stdout/file/webhook sinks and structured refusal on unknown schemes; `feedback <text>` with local JSONL by default and configurable upstream POST; both surfaced in agent-context so the agent knows whether the upstream channel exists.

Output that is stdout-only with no way to report friction is a blocker; output sinks that exist but aren't atomic, or feedback that exists but the upstream channel isn't discoverable, is friction; structured delivery and discoverable feedback, both versioned in introspection, are the optimization target.

---

## A note on the architecture beneath these

Most of Tier 2 is hard to apply by hand and easy to apply mechanically. Cross-CLI vocabulary, three-layer introspection, async detection, profile precedence, delivery routing: every one of them is the kind of thing you'd be inconsistent about across a dozen subcommands if you wrote them by hand, and trivially consistent about if a schema or codegen pipeline writes them.

That's why Cloudflare's TypeScript schema is the load-bearing detail of their post, not a side note. Generating the CLI, the SDKs, the Terraform provider, and the MCP server from one source is what makes ten principles hold across thousands of operations without drift. I've been applying the same approach in projects I'm working on right now. Everything in Tier 2 lands on each generated CLI for free, because a template wrote it, not a human.

If you're maintaining a hand-written CLI of any size, the consistency bar will keep rising, and the only way to keep up is to move enforcement out of code review and into the schema or the build.

---

## Design for agents first

Every principle here makes the CLI better for humans too. None of these are concessions to agents. They're good CLI design we used to be able to skip because humans worked around the gaps.

There's a deeper assumption underneath all of it. The classic [Command Line Interface Guidelines](https://clig.dev/) treat a human at a terminal as the primary user, with agents as a tolerated secondary audience. That's no longer the right default. Cloudflare puts it directly in [their post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cf-cli-local-explorer/): "Increasingly, agents are the primary customer of our APIs." Their whole schema approach is built around that. HeyGen launched their CLI with "agent" in the marketing copy. Design for agents first, and humans benefit. Designing for humans first and bolting on agent support is what produces the inconsistent, prompt-prone, stdout-only CLIs the first five principles exist to correct.

These 10 are what I'm currently designing against. They'll keep evolving — I had to replace the original 7 a few weeks after publishing them, and the same thing will probably happen here.

This was also published on my blog at [https://trevinsays.com](https://trevinsays.com/).

This framework comes from three places: the CLIs I've been building and generating in the last several weeks, Cloudflare's [The CLI for all of Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cf-cli-local-explorer/) (2026-04-13), and HeyGen's [CLI launch](https://github.com/heygen-com/heygen-cli) and accompanying [skills repo](https://github.com/heygen-com/skills). The original [seven principles](https://trevinsays.com/p/7-principles-for-agent-friendly-clis) are still online; treat this post as their replacement, not a sequel.
